						<h3 class="about-title">Biography</h3>
						<p class="bio">Kai Alami is a Canadian musician best known for his sold-out bedroom concerts. Though an amateur musician, he pursued a multitude of instruments, ranging from the trumpet to the guitar to the piano. His passion for music ignited during his years of high school, and he took to expressing his passion in his own musical career. He found inspiration to further hone his musical skills and styles. He is self-taught in many of his instruments and is continuing to improve daily. In 2020, Kai formed a casual garage band as the group's lead guitarist.</p>
						<p class="bio">Kai's musical style derives clear inspiration from classic jazz and rock styles. With lighthearted yet groovy sounds, Kai aims to share, in a genuine way, what he himself finds joy in. He hopes to uniquely express his musical style while creating his own music.</p>

				<div class="col-md-12 text-left animate-box" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
					<p class="bio" style="margin-top: -25px;">As a part of his high school's concert and jazz bands, Kai has no shortage of performance experience under his belt. Wielding the trumpet, he has performed a plethora of pieces as an ensemble numerous times on the big stage. Kai incorporates his musical style in his solo jazz performances to express himself during concerts.</p>
					<p class="bio">As a continuously growing musician, Kai is perpetually honing and improving his music. His love for music has only just begun, and will continue to grow in the years to come. Hopefully, he can extend his musical reach beyond performing in his bedroom.</p>

						<h3 class="about-title">Personal Experience and Education</h3>
						<p class="bio">My first exposure to music was through piano lessons at the age of seven. I was often told that I had a good ear for music, but as a young child I had very little interest in music, and with time I eventually quit piano. Although it was only a short time, I did retain some of my learning. Piano lessons were where I learned to read music and understand rhythms, scales, and harmony.</p>
						<p class="bio">During my last two years of elementary school, I learned a little about playing the clarinet, as music was a compulsory part of our education. However, it wasn't until high school where I began to actually enjoy and appreciate music. Throughout my four years of high school, I've learned a great amount about both playing instruments and musical theory. I continued the clarinet from elementary school for my first two years. I practiced not only individual playing, but playing music as a band. My high school music experience was my first exposure to playing music with a group of other people, which I found enjoyment in, furthering my passion for music.</p>
						<p class="bio">Our school band performed in multiple concerts during my high school years. In grade nine, I performed in the annual winter concert held at our school as a part of our junior concert band's clarinet section. Soon after, feeling inspired to learn a new instrument,  I began learning the trumpet and joined our junior jazz band. That spring, I performed in the annual spring concert, held at Flato Markham Theatre, as a part of both concert and jazz bands. In addition, that year our band took a trip to Montreal for a couple of nights, where we listened to a live symphony orchestra perform. During this trip, we also performed for the International Rhythms Music Festival, where we were judged and given feedback. In the summer near the end of the school year, our jazz band performed at a small restaurant near our school called Rockford's.</p>
						<p class="bio">Much like in the previous year, in my second year of high school I was involved in both concert and jazz bands, playing the clarinet and trumpet respectively. I continued to learn, practice and improve my musical skills throughout the year. My tenth grade year ended with another jazz performance at Rockford's.</p>
						<p class="bio">In the 11th grade, I chose to play the trumpet in both concert and jazz bands, as I became increasingly more interested in the trumpet over the clarinet. We once again held a winter concert in December of that year, however, due to the COVID-19 pandemic that followed soon after, we were unable to perform live anymore. I continued to practice trumpet independently during those times. Our band decided to hold a "virtual" performance, where we would each individually record our part of a piece, which would then be edited and produced into a video.</p>
						<p class="bio">During my second year in high school, I began playing the piano again, this time on my own. I think my enjoyment in playing instruments in a band inspired me to try the piano that I abandoned years ago. I found pieces of music that I actually wanted to play and continued casually practicing, and still do to this day. Near the beginning of my third year, I started self-teaching myself the guitar. The guitar quickly became my favorite instrument and influenced my taste in music greatly. I eventually bought my first electric guitar and began playing with a few friends in a casual garage band.</p>
						<p class="bio">I don't have much experience or education in music, but I know for sure that I will love playing music for the rest of my life.</p>
